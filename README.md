# BI-Mini_Project
Retail store analysis for beverage brands is rooted in the pursuit of enhanced profitability, 
improved customer satisfaction, and a competitive edge in the market. By optimizing the selection 
of beverage brands and refining inventory management practices, the store aims to bolster its 
financial performance through increased sales and decreased waste from overstocked or expired 
products. Understanding and catering to customer preferences not only elevates satisfaction levels 
but also cultivates customer loyalty, resulting in sustained business success. Furthermore, by 
offering a well-curated array of beverage brands that align with consumer demand, the store can 
differentiate itself from competitors and potentially attract more patrons.
